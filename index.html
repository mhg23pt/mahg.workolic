      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Bingham" target="_blank"> Stuart Bingham</a> claimed his 
        first World Snooker Championship title in 2015, at the age of 38, by defeating Shaun Murphy in the final, 
        becoming the oldest British champion since the beginning of the modern era. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Selby" target="_blank"> Mark Selby</a>, known for his methodical 
        play and psychological resilience, lifted the trophy three times in this period: in 2016, overcoming Ding 
        Junhui; in 2017, against John Higgins; and again in 2021, by beating Shaun Murphy. In between these triumphs, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Williams_(snooker_player)" target="_blank"> Mark Williams</a> 
        returned to the top in 2018, prevailing over John Higgins in a very closely contested final, rekindling his 
        champion status fifteen years after his previous title. In 2019, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Trump" target="_blank"> Judd Trump</a> clinched his first world 
        title by defeating John Higgins, demonstrating precision and consistency, he thus established himself among 
        the best.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan" target="_blank">
        Ronnie O’Sullivan</a>, nicknamed “The Rocket” for his speed and creativity, lifted the title again in 2020, 
        defeating Kyren Wilson, and repeated the feat in 2022 by overcoming Judd Trump, equalling Stephen Hendry’s 
        record of seven trophies in the modern era. In the three most recent years, the tournament produced maiden 
        champions: in 2023,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Brecel" target="_blank"> Luca Brecel</a> 
        became the first Belgian to win the World Snooker Championship, beating Mark Selby in the final and demonstrating 
        the expansion of snooker beyond its traditional British strongholds. In 2024, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson" target="_blank">Kyren Wilson</a> secured his first 
        World Snooker Championship title after an intense final against Mark Selby, establishing himself as one 
        of the leading players of the new generation. Just yesterday, the 2025 World Championship concluded with 
        an unprecedented winner. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Xintong" target="_blank">Zhao Xintong</a>, 
        the 28-year-old Chinese player, made history for his country by 
        defeating Mark Williams 18–12 in the final. In doing so, he became the first Asian—and indeed the first 
        non-European—player to win snooker’s world championship. In summary, the last decade has showcased both 
        the continuity of established legends such as Selby and O’Sullivan and the emergence of new champions from 
        outside the United Kingdom, bearing witness to the globalisation and high competitive standard of 
        professional snooker.</p>
